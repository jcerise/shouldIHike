# Should I Hike?

A simple FireFox OS application that determines, using relevant weather data, if you should go hiking
in a specified area at a specified time or not.

#### Running/building the app

You will need a Weather Underground API Key. After acquiring your key, create a _js/config.js_ file and create
the config object.

    var config = {
      "wu_api_key": "<your api key>"
    };


This app is based on the FireFox OS Boilerplate App by Rob Nyman (https://github.com/robnyman/Firefox-OS-Boilerplate-App)
